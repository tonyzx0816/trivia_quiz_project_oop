Trivia Quiz Project

This project is a trivia quiz game built using Python. It retrieves a list of trivia questions from a data file (data.py) and presents them to the user one at a time. The user can answer each question as True or False, and the game keeps track of their score.
*********************************
Usage:

1. Save the four files (main.py, data.py, question_model.py, and quiz_brain.py) in the same directory.

2. Run the main.py script using Pycharm.

The program will display trivia questions and prompt you to enter True or False answers. Once you answer all the questions, it will display your final score.
